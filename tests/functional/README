Hot to use them functionnal tests?
**********************************

You have to launch SeleniumRC server on a machine connected to the network (this
machine is called "proxy").

You can find SeleniumRC server at the following address:
http://www.openqa.org/selenium-rc/download.action

The proxy needs to have the required browsers installed. This can be your
developement machine.

Launch SeleniumRC server:
cd the/path/where/is/selenium-rc-server
java -jar selenium-server.jar

It should listen to port 4444 and witing for requests.

Then you can laucnh the functionnal tests just like you would launch unit tests:
change test modules/MODULE/tests/functionnal/your-functionnal-test.php
